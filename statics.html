                            <p class="paragraph">The articles shows how Spanish people, in the last years, have ended up living in smaller spaces than they did in the past. It is illustrated with the example of Madrid, to which the maps belong.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph">The cartography was extracted from the Catastro website, which include all buildings in Spain, with the Python library requests. It was later transformed into a geojson file with QGIS, where it was also coloured, depending on the year of construction. The rest of the editing was made with Figma.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph">This piece helped me and my team understand how to operate this datebase, which we later used to build a map with all swimming pools in the country or the heating demand map.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">Granada is the 20th biggest city in Spain, in terms of population. The plan an association from the city is to integrate 44 nearby towns to create a more populated and extensive surface that can collect more money and, therefore, have better public services.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph">There are two graphics in this piece: one comparing of big The Great Granada would be, compared in terms of surface and population to other Spanish towns, such as Badajoz or Murcia. The other shows the borders of the imaginary new city, as well as the population that it now has and what it would have with the fusion. It all was made with Figma.</p>

                    <div class="text">
                        <p class="paragraph">The article is inspired by a piece from The Washington Post in which they tried to figure out how many days of AC where necessary in each city of the US if temperature increased the way they are doing now, due to climate change.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph">We tried to do a similar article for the Spanish case, since, given its location, the damage that climate change can cause to the country is bigger than in other European countries. We worked with data from AEMET and a grid that we used to create the evolution maps and that helped us concentrate the information. All the data analysis was made with Python.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph">The maps were made with QGIS and later edited with Figma. On the other hand, the small multiples for the cities where created with R, later exported as pdf and edited in Figma, as well.</p>

It has affected even more all those crops that had been previously rain-fed and are now irrigated, mostly because farmers can get bigger profits from them.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph">The information was extracted from the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture and all tables where clean with Excel. The maps were extracted from an API belonging to Eurostat with the library requests in Python. The geojsons resulting where imported to QGIS, where they were edited and exported as images. The final touches, as well as the other static graphic included in the piece were made with Figma.</p>
