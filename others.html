For this piece, in which so many talented many have worked, I had the chance to extract all the data and analyse it.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph">We worked with one the Spotify API endpoints that returns numeric information of all songs, including how cheerful or energetic or danceable they are. We applied this to all number one hits Spain has add since 1980 and got the ‘median song’ of every decade. This means the song whose values from the API were closest to the median values of every decade.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">We made this article with information from the census published at the end of 2022. A colleague of ours from the paper told us if we could see if Spain was a segregated country or if the immigrant population was more or less integrated with the natives.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph">We had pretty clear what the map had to look like and the information included in it was easily analysed and painted. The problem came with all matches we wanted to do of this data with other variables, such as the income or the what people in this areas had voted in past elections.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">The map displays the most voted parties in each unit represented, as well as the most voted political blocks and the votes that the main parties received that night. Most times, we have to request this information to some administrative organ that hands it to ourselves when they want to. We have to work efficiently to make sure that we are the firsts ones to publish such information. This not only applies to the map, it is only a small example of how we work at the paper at elections nights.</p>

Some other times, we use it to have fun and delight ourselves a tiny bit. This is what this article is about, and also kind of a bet between colleagues.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph">In this article, we were trying to prove that the contestants of the Spanish reality-show “Temptation Island” could betray themselves with their language when still they had not cheated on their partners, but were going to. For this, we used the subtitles of the four first episodes of all seasons and extracted the key words. Later, we analysed the sentences those words were linked to and tried to only keep those in which the possible cheater talked about his personal experiences in the villa.</p>
