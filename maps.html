                            <p class="paragraph">The map shows the heating costs of Spanish homes, how much the same thing would cost if the building was more energy-efficient and how much the renovation would be. The article pretends to aim Spaniards to invest in their homes so they would not need as much heating power as they do, which would benefit their finances and the environment.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph">The data to create the map was extracted from Catastro and had to be reduced, so Mapbox could process it. For this, I used geopandas, a Python library for geospatial analysis and, because some files where really heavy, the command line with some libraries, like jq. After this, I uploaded the map to the server with Mapbox CLI and later styled it with Mapbox GL JS.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph">It was quite a challenge, considering the files we were working with were 12Gb heavy and that we had never made a project of this characteristics. </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">The Spanish Ministry of Transportation had published very detailed information of how many people had to mandatorily move and where they had to go each day (they considered people that had to go to work, to university or school). We wanted to do something with the information and ended up creating this map with the most frecuent journeys that Spaniards made each day.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph">For this piece, we extracted the data and cartography from the ministry and analysed it geopandas in Python. We needed to merge both the csv and the geojson in order to get a way of painting all features. We extracted the centroids and later connected all lines with the information we had.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph">Later, we created the map with Mapbox. It included all journeys that Spaniards did with frequency of three weeks a month or more, the distances they had to cover and the most frequent destinations, considering every town available.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">The piece was relatively easy to do and the only obstacle we found was the publishing date: we had to publish the article not long after the Spanish Statistics Institute released the information.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph">The data was analysed with the library pandas in Python and later joined to the cartography we had in Mapbox. We later created the map with the same tool.</p>
